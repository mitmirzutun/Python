## frogs.py
In this case *n* is defined as the (whole) number of options greater or equal than 1 the frog has, when he starts at one shore of the river with the last option being the other shore of the river
### Functions
#### all\_possible\_jumps
This function computes all possible jumps ranging from instantly jumping to the opposite shore to hopping on each option the frog can land on.
#### jump\_probabilities
This function uses _all\_possible\_jumps_ to calculate the probability of the frog hopping any ammount of hops for a given *n* to get to the other side.
#### e\_wert
This function uses jump\_probabilities to calculate the expected value of jumps for the frog for any given *n*
## fileLib
### Functions
#### explode(sourceString, searchString)
Searches the String *searchString* in the String *sourceString* and returns an Array of Strings cut at the places where the String *searchString* was with *searchString* removed.
#### replace(sourceString, stringToBeCutOut, replacementString):
Searches the String *stringToBeCutOut* in the String *sourceString* and replaces with the String *replacementString*
#### strip(sourceString, stringToBeRemoved)
Removes the String *stringToBeRemoved* from the String *sourceString*
### Classes
#### File
##### Functions
###### \_\_init\_\_(filename, readMode)
Initializes the class and takes the file name and the mode it reads the file. Possible input for *readMode* are r (read), r+ (read and write, does not clear whole file), w (write), w+ (write and read, clears whole file), and a (append) Default of *readMode* is read (r)
###### explode(searchString)
Gives the information in the file and the String *searchString* to the the Function *explode* and returns the array it gets from the Function
###### openFile()
Opens the file if it's closed
###### close()
Closes the file if it's open
###### read()
Returns an array of every line of the file with the new line ("\n") removed with the Function strip
#### CSV
##### Functions
###### \_\_init\_\_(filename, readMode)
Initializes the class and takes the file name and the mode it reads the file. Possible input for *readMode* are r (read), r+ (read and write, does not clear whole file), w (write), w+ (write and read, clears whole file), and a (append) Default of *readMode* is read (r)
###### explode(searchString)
Gives the information in the file and the String *searchString* to the the Function *explode* and returns the array it gets from the Function
###### openFile()
Opens the file if it's closed
###### close()
Closes the file if it's open
###### read()
Returns an array of every line of the file with the new line ("\n") and any blanks removed with the Function strip
##FileUnpivoter
The FileUnpivoter is a tool to change the data from Eurostat to a format that is compartible for elasticsearch. It uses the fileLib
